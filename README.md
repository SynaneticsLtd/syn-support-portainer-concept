# Portainer Concept

## Initial Idea
- Deploy a local instance of the Portainer image on appliances to:
  - Monitor for image upgrades.
  - Automatically update images.
  - Further automate tasks using `portainer-setup.ps1`:
    - Opens required ports.
    - Produces a log file for security.

### Long-Term Solution
- Run Portainer instances using **Cloud Run**.
- Implement a full CI/CD pipeline.
- Enable notifications and heartbeat integration.

### Centralized Management
- Attach Portainer agents to a Portainer server for centralized control.
- **Further Investigation**: Explore additional management capabilities.

## Ideas/Contributions

### Reverse Proxy Consideration
- Evaluate the need for running containers behind a reverse proxy.
- Current container runs locally without requiring networking modifications.

---

## Testing Plan

### Validate Automatic Updates
1. Deploy an older version of the Portainer image.
2. Shorten the watch period to confirm automatic updates function correctly.

### Integration Testing
1. Test integration of Portainer agents with the centralized server.
2. Verify centralized monitoring and update capabilities.

## Select Environment for Testing
- **Potential Options**:
  - Sandpit environments.
  - Local setups.
- **Identify Candidates**:
  - Evaluate customers suitable for centralized management portal testing.

---

## Aspects Completed
- Created a setup script (`portainer-setup.ps1`) for:
  - Opening required ports with error handling.
  - Logging actions for security purposes.
- Modified the `docker-compose.yml`:
  - Added `server-compose` to represent the management VM/platform.
- **Next Step**: Test on a local machine.

## Configuration Monitoring Solutions

1. **GitHub Workflows**:
   - Automate configuration changes.
   - Utilize **GitHub Docs** for workflow creation.

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Implement pipelines for effective configuration monitoring and management.

3. **Portainer API Integrations**:
   - Detect and manage configuration changes through API capabilities.

## Authentication Concerns

### Potential Disruptions
- Evaluate risks caused by authentication changes.

### Notifications
- Investigate solutions for alerts using:
  - Elastic Stack.
  - Google Cloud-based tools.

---

## Heartbeat Implementation

### Elastic Stack
- Implement a heartbeat mechanism using Elastic Stack for monitoring.

### Google Cloud Monitoring
- Evaluate integration with GCP's monitoring tools.
- Explore advanced heartbeat solutions with GCP features.
