# Portainer Concept

## Initial Idea
Deploy an instance of the Portainer image locally on appliances to:
- Monitor for image upgrades.
- Automatically update them.
- Further automation includes portainer-setup.ps1 - opens required ports and produces log file for security.

**Long-term Solution:**
- Run Portainer instances from **Cloud Run**.
- Enable full CI/CD implementation.
- Allow for notification and heartbeat integration.

**Centralized Management:**
- Attach a Portainer agent to a Portainer server to create a centralized management portal.
- **Further Investigation Required**: Identify additional possibilities.

## Ideas/Contributions

### Container Running Off a Reverse Proxy?
- Current container runs locally without requiring modification at the networking level.

---

## Testing Plan

1. **Validate Automatic Updates**
   - Set the image to an older version.
   - Shorten the watch period to confirm updates occur as expected.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the integration of Portainer agents with the centralized server.
   - Ensure centralized updates and monitoring function as intended.

---

## Select Environment for Testing
- **Potential Options:**
  - Sandpit environments.
  - Local setups.
- **Identify Candidates:**
  - Look for customers suitable for testing the centralized management portal.

---

## Review Existing Environments
1. Assess customization levels.
2. Investigate modifications to `docker-compose` files to include Portainer agents.


---

## Configuration Monitoring Solutions

1. Explore **GitHub Workflows**:
   - Automate configuration changes.
   - Use **GitHub Docs** to create workflows.

2. Leverage **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Monitor and manage configurations effectively.

3. Investigate Portainer API Integrations:
   - Detect and manage configuration changes.

---

## Authentication Concerns
- **Potential Disruptions**:
  - Assess risks due to authentication changes.

- **Notifications**:
  - Investigate solutions (Elastic or Google Cloud-based) to alert on issues.

---

## Heartbeat Implementation

1. **Elastic Stack**:
   - Consider implementing a heartbeat mechanism for monitoring.

2. **Google Cloud Monitoring**:
   - If migrating to GCP, evaluate integration with GCP's monitoring tools.
   - Explore enhanced heartbeat solutions through GCP features.
